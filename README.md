This library is the implementation of [web-ifc](https://github.com/tomvandig/web-ifc) for [THREE.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/). This allows to parse and generate the Three.js geometry of IFC models in JavaScript, both in the browser and on a Node server, as well as query the IFC data and override it.

This is [the official IFCLoader of Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).

## Status

**web-ifc-three** creates efficient geometries that you can add to your Three.js scene. You can then use the methods provided in our API to work with that geometry, including efficient selection, visibility, subset generation, etc.

Similarly to web-ifc, although it is quite stable and fast already, web-ifc-three is in **pre-alpha status** until ifc support matures. The list of currently supported ifc elements, or level of support for different ifc types, is an undocumented work in progress.
